## üß≠ Overview

The **Letter of Credit (LoC)** is one of the 36 trade documents defined in the *Key Trade Documents & Data Elements (KTDDE)* ecosystem.  
It formalizes the financial guarantee provided by an issuing bank to a beneficiary (exporter) on behalf of an applicant (importer).  

In this application profile, each part of the LoC (document data, financial terms, parties, shipment, and conditions) is modeled semantically using the **KTDDE Ontology** and validated with **SHACL Shapes** ‚Äî ensuring interoperability across banking, logistics, and customs systems.

## üåê Example Use Case

> **FinnLam Oy (Finland)** exports glued laminated timber to **Tokyo Builders Ltd. (Japan)**.  
> Payment is secured via an irrevocable, confirmed Letter of Credit issued by **Nordea Bank Finland Plc** and advised/confirmed by **Mitsui Bank Ltd.**, Tokyo.  
> Shipment from *Port of Helsinki (FIHEL)* to *Port of Tokyo (JPTYO)* under **CIF Tokyo (Incoterms¬Æ 2020)** terms.

This digital LoC is expressed as a **Verifiable Credential**, enabling automatic validation, document chaining (invoice, transport, certificate of origin), and audit-proof transaction evidence in a **Business Information Data Space**.

## üß© Interoperability Highlights

- **Ontology-based modeling:** built on KTDDE OWL v0.0.4 and aligned with UN/CEFACT and ISO 20022 semantics.  
- **Validation-ready:** LoC SHACL Shape ensures all mandatory data points are complete and consistent.  
- **Cross-domain integration:** supports alignment with eFTI, ESPR, and EU Business Wallet ecosystems.  
- **Verifiable credentials:** natively supports W3C VC / JSON-LD for issuance and exchange.
